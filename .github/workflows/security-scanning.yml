# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# The default values used in the docker build commands are the root
# directory '.' and the dockerfile name of 'Dockerfile'. If there is 
# a need to change these do so in your local workflow template (this file) and
# change them there. HINT: Look at the bottom of this file.

# This workflow checks out code, builds an image, performs a container image
# vulnerability scan with Anchore's Grype tool, and generates an
# SBOM via Anchore's Syft tool

# For more information on Anchore's container image scanning tool Grype, see
# https://github.com/anchore/grype
